# Vipera

Vipera stands for "**V**isual **I**ntelligence-**P**romoted **E**nd Use**r** **A**uditing" is an interactive system for streamlining and enhancing the systematicness of large-scale T2I model auditing. It is designed to help people test text-to-image models at scale, understand the model behavior in depth, and come up with meaningful auditing criteria. 

Specifically, Vipera facilitates structured multi-faceted analysis through the visual cue of scene graph, where the auditing criteria are organized hierarchically and associated with scenic semantics of images. Additionally, Vipera incorporates LLM-powered auditing suggestions to uncover new avenues for analysis and facilitate exploration within the auditing space. 

**Vipera has been accepted as a Late-Breaking Work paper in [CHI 2025](https://chi2025.acm.org/).** [[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11113), [[Poster]](https://yhuang.top/pdf/vipera_poster.pdf)
