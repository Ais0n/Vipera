Ouroboros

This is a simple React powered NextJS App.

Note: Since the repo is not private, I have created .env.local file to store the API credentials. You'll need to manually download and place it in the root directory of the project (i.e. somewhere near where the package.json file is located). I'll share that file via Slack!

Instructions:
1. Install latest NodeJS (any v18+)
2. run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Copy the `.env.local` file to root of project directory, i.e. near `package.json`.
4. In terminal, navigate to project directory and type:  `npm run build && npm run dev`  -> then view site in browser at: http://localhost:3000
5. For different pages, view site in browser at: http://localhost:3000/pagename (pagename is in page folder)
